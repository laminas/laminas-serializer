Each adapter has its own strengths. In some cases, not every PHP datatype (e.g., objects) can be converted to a string representation. In most such cases, the type will be converted to a similar type that is serializable. As an example, PHP objects will often be cast to arrays. If this fails, a Laminas\\Serializer\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface will be thrown. The PhpSerialize Adapter The Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpSerialize adapter uses the built-in serialize() / unserialize() functions, and is a good default adapter choice. Available options include: Option Data Type Default Value Description unserialize_class_whitelist array or bool true The allowed classes for unserialize(), see unserialize() for more information. Only available on PHP 7.0 or higher. The IgBinary Adapter Igbinary was originally released by Sulake Dynamoid Oy and since 2011-03-14 moved to PECL and maintained by Pierre Joye. It's a drop-in replacement for the standard PHP serializer. Instead of using a costly textual representation, igbinary stores PHP data structures in a compact binary form. Savings are significant when using memcached or similar memory based storages for serialized data. You need the igbinary PHP extension installed on your system in order to use this adapter. There are no configurable options for this adapter. The Json Adapter The JSON adapter provides a bridge to the laminas-json component. Available options include: Option Data Type Default Value cycle_check boolean false object_decode_type Laminas\\Json\\Json::TYPE_* Laminas\\Json\\Json::TYPE_ARRAY enable_json_expr_finder boolean false The PhpCode Adapter The Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpCode adapter generates a parsable PHP code representation using var_export() . To restore, the data will be executed using eval . There are no configuration options for this adapter. Warning: Unserializing objects Objects will be serialized using the __set_state magic method. If the class doesn't implement this method, a fatal error will occur during execution. Warning: Uses eval() The PhpCode adapter utilizes eval() to unserialize. This introduces both a performance and potential security issue as a new process will be executed. Typically, you should use the PhpSerialize adapter unless you require human-readability of the serialized data. The PythonPickle Adapter This adapter converts PHP types to a Python Pickle string representation. With it, you can read the serialized data with Python and read Pickled data from Python with PHP. This adapter requires the laminas-math component: $ composer require laminas/laminas-math Available options include: Option Data Type Default Value Description protocol integer (0/1/2/3) 0 The Pickle protocol version used on serialize Datatype merging (PHP to Python Pickle) PHP Type Python Pickle Type NULL None boolean boolean integer integer float float string string array list list array map dictionary object dictionary Datatype merging (Python Pickle to PHP) Python Pickle Type PHP Type None NULL boolean boolean integer integer long integer , float , string , or Laminas\\Serializer\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface float float string string bytes string unicode string string UTF-8 list array list tuple array list dictionary array map All other types Laminas\\Serializer\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface The Wddx Adapter WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange) is a programming-language-, platform-, and transport-neutral data interchange mechanism for passing data between different environments and different computers.

Any time an error is encountered serializing or unserializing, the adapter will throw a Laminas\\Serializer\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface . Because an application often uses only one serializer internally, it is possible to define and use a default serializer.

Breaking Changes Static Methods in Serializer Implementation The biggest breaking change in v3 relates to the Laminas\\Serializer\\Serializer . This class has been removed due to its potential side-effects and for not following the S within SOLID . This class was: - a registry (by providing a method to both persist and provide a \"default\" serializer instance) - a factory (by providing methods to create objects based on arguments passed to methods) - a serializer (by providing serialize and unserialize which then called magically an AdapterInterface implementation) To enable projects and 3rd-party libraries to provide their own serializer implementations (which are also available via the AdapterPluginManager ), this class was removed in favor of dependency injection. The amount of work to migrate projects consuming the Laminas\\Serializer\\Serializer class depends on the way how it was used in projects. Projects Making Use of Serializer#setDefaultAdapter In case you are using this method within a laminas-mvc or mezzio project, laminas got your back. You can now configure the projects default adapter by using the dependency configuration . If your project uses Serializer#setDefaultAdapter outside of laminas-mvc or mezzio projects, you have to provide your own registry. You can either copy the current implementation into your project or implement an own minimal implementation such as: namespace MyNamespace; use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface;use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpSerialize; final class SerializerRegistry { private static null|AdapterInterface $adapter = null; public static function getDefaultAdapter(): AdapterInterface { if (self::$adapter) { return self::$adapter; } return self::$adapter = new PhpSerialize(); } public static function setDefaultAdapter(AdapterInterface $adapter): void { self::$adapter = $adapter; } } It is highly recommended to use dependency injection over a registry. Projects Making Use of Serializer#getDefaultAdapter In case you are using this method within a laminas-mvc or mezzio project, laminas got your back. You can now retrieve the projects default adapter by using the container: $container-&gt;get(\\Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface::class); . This will always provide an instance of AdapterInterface ( PhpSerialize by-default unless configured otherwise) and therefore provides the same value as Serializer#getDefaultAdapter . Outside of laminas frameworks, the changes are depending on how the project is interacting with the Serializer class. If your project does not call Serializer#setDefaultAdapter , code can be replaced with new \\Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpSerialize() . If you think that is not a good solution, feel free to implement your own registry. Refer to the section above on how to do so. Projects Making Use of Serializer#serialize or Serializer#unserialize There are no replacements for these methods. You can either instantiate PhpSerialize adapter (which is the default) or, in case your projects uses Serializer#setDefaultAdapter , please refer to the section above . Projects Making Use of Serializer#factory This method has multiple ways to get called: Passing an Instance of AdapterInterface use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpSerialize; $adapter = new PhpSerialize(); $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapter); // unnecessary method call $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapter, ['unserialize_class_whitelist' =&gt; false]); // unnecessary method call In both cases, the $adapter was already an instance of an adapter prior calling the factory method. The factory method always immediately returned the $adapter in case it was not a string and therefore, the method calls can be simply removed. Passing an Already Known class-string use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\PhpSerialize; $adapterClassName = PhpSerialize::class; $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapterClassName); $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapterClassName, ['unserialize_class_whitelist' =&gt; false]); In this example, we obviously are aware that we want a PhpSerialize serializer. Please directly instantiate the serializer instead of calling the factory method. Passing a Service Alias $adapterAlias = 'phpserialize'; $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapterAlias); $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapterAlias, ['unserialize_class_whitelist' =&gt; false]); Same as the example where we pass class-string . Please refactor your code to directly instantiate the serializer instead. Passing an Unknown Value use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface; function myfunction(string|AdapterInterface $adapterAliasOrClassStringOrInstance, ?array $adapterOptions = null): string { $adapter = Serializer::factory($adapterAliasOrClassStringOrInstance, $adapterOptions); return $adapter-&gt;serialize(new stdClass()); } This will require you to use the Laminas\\Serializer\\AdapterPluginManager . use Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface; use Laminas\\Serializer\\AdapterPluginManager; function myfunction(string|AdapterInterface $adapterAliasOrClassStringOrInstance, ?array $adapterOptions = null): string { $adapter = $adapterAliasOrClassStringOrInstance; if (!$adapter instanceof AdapterInterface) { $plugins = new AdapterPluginManager(); $adapter = $plugins-&gt;build($adapterAliasOrClassStringOrInstance, $adapterOptions); } return $adapter-&gt;serialize(new stdClass()); } Niche Serializer Implementations With v3, some of the more niche serializer implementations were removed. MsgPack PythonPickle Wddx All of these serializers were already deprecated in v2.15.0. For a more detailed reasoning on why these were removed please refer to the RFC .
